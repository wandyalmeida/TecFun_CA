                    <p> <b>TECFUN</b> is a private company but works with a group of people who are looking for a common objective, the best service for childrens.

                    <p> The project has initially targeted group children between 2 and 7 years old. We are developing tematics games for apps where children can interact with matching symbols and pictures, words and colours, animals and names. 
                        <br><br>
                        The big goal is to help parents and teachers in their children's learning process, using technology as a tool, one thing that is already present in our children's lives.
                        <br><br>
                        Arousing children's interest and keeping them engaged has been an increasing challenge for teachers. For this reason, many schools have adopted technological resources such as educational online games. In addition to making the learning process more stimulating, this tool helps students to develop logical reasoning, creativity and problem solving. 
                        <br><br>
                        Thinkers like Jean Piaget, advocate the use of games in the learning process. The educational games help chidrens to learn something and develop skills while having fun.
